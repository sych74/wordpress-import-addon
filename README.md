# WordPress Migrator 

This repository provides a tool that helps *Virtuozzo Application Platform for WordPress* admins migrate clients' WordPress projects from other hosting platforms like *Plesk* or *cPanel*. 

The mostly automated process is quick and straightforward. It requires just the client's credentials to access their remote hosting via SSH to create WordPress project copies at the appropriate user's account at *Virtuozzo Application Platform for WordPress*. You can find a detailed step-by-step **[WordPress Migrator](https://www.virtuozzo.com/application-platform-ops-docs/wordpress-migrator/)** guide in our documentation.
